  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Junior developer working at Squared Up. Graduated with a 1<sup>st</sup> class degree
    in Computer Science at the University of Kent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I have several interests. Most revolve around technology, and using simple
    ideas to share exciting experiences through the web. Currently really excited about the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Component API</a>,
    and occasionally playing with Web GL (also excited for the new
    <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8482/web-high-level-shading-language/">Web HLSL</a>).
    When I&rsquo;m not working on code, I&rsquo;m often out running, at the <del>gym</del> pub,
    or spending time with loved ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to find out what really makes me tick, send me an
    <a href="mailto:hello@samlord.me">email</a>, and I&rsquo;d be happy to get in touch.

      This is the real secret of life &#8212; to be completely engaged with what you are doing in
      the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.
